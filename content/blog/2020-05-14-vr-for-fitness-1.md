I really admire what they are doing here. Seems like the Within crew has done a thorough job in the design and implementation. I'm skeptical about the business model. And given the market size I don't think you can restrict yourself to only one device, even if that is probably the market-footprint leader for this year. Also it doesn't really make sense to price a premium service for premium customers and yet only support the cheapest (well, 2nd cheapest) low-cost device. It's not THAT much more work just to support everything via OpenVR.[](https://www.protocol.com/vr-exercise-within-supernatural)
